* We continue to post about locations as long as they still have open slots. We'll re-post a location every 1-2 minutes if it still has slots
* If we haven't posted a location in the past 2 minutes, it probably no longer has slots.
* When locations have appointments available, they are often only available in small numbers (sometimes only a single appointment is available). Others may book them before you if they are faster.
* To complicate things even more, the Rite Aid website may sometimes report no appointments available even when they are available due to jankiness in their website. This appears to be a relatively common occurance. It's possible that it may work if you keep trying.
* Sometimes Twitter rate limits our posts, so we may be unable to post updates for up to three hours.
* We monitor all Rite Aid locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan, plus a handful in Queens.
* We post Rite Aid sites with new appointments on twitter: https://twitter.com/RiteNyc
